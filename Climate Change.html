<h2 align="left">What Is Climate Change</h2>
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Climate change describes a global phenomenon called global warming. The ongoing increase in global average temperature effects the Earth's climate system. Emissions of greenhouse gases could change Earth's energy balance and climate. <br>

<h3 align="left">What Causes Climate Change </h3>
Climate change is caused when  greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas causes a large chunk of carbon emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources. <br>

<h4 align="left">What Are The Disadvantages Of Climate Change </h4>
Some disadvantages of climate change are:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Due to climate change the atmosphere around us also changes causing people to get sick.</li>
<li>Climate change also lead to sudden outburst of weather. For example, a lot of rainfall will lead to flood as for hot weather will lead to melting of ice causing flooding of urban and rural areas.</li>
<li>Over active climate change can lead us to many destructions like a heavy rainfall which can destroy homes of many people causing them to be homeless.​</li>
<li>People's work and plans would be cancelled due to unpredicted climate change and weather.​</li> <br>
</ul>

<h5 align="left">How Can We Prevent Climate Change</h5>
Here are some ways to prevent climate change:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>We should use renewable energy like solar system. If we can't, we should use the least amount of electricity we can.​</li>
<li>We should use public transport to stop higher carbon emissions.​</li>
<li>We should plant more trees and plants.</li>
<li>We should travel the least.​</li>
<li>We should throw away less garbage.</li>
<li>We should apply the 3 Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle).​</li>
